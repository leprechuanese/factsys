First of all, sorry for my ugly English,
but it seems to me it's better to have poor documentation than nothing.


		      Editor of DBF-files BDBFS.EXE
		      -----------------------------

			   Programmer's guide
			   ------------------

	Following does not apply for the complete description, but
 probably it will be useful to somebody.

	The current description corresponds to the version
			BDBFS 1.15

	 1. Why BDBFS?
	 ----------------

	And really - there are a lot of analogues, only to author
 the following viewers/browsers are known:

	- dbview by Trophimenko ~3k!!!!
	- dbview by Tsarenko ~32k but with edition and search
	- popdbf by Bowen-software - sole TSR, known for me
	- vdbf by Rodionoff, served by a push for development
	- d123 by Deveza
	- dbeditor by Jeff Parnau
	- dbfedit by Lau Preston
	- dbed by Dmitrieff
	- cdbf by Tchehuta
	- dbc by Kresin
	- dbfview by Tibor Kovach
	- clut by Sergio Cocci

And thus I do not doubt at all, that all is listed not.
It is possible also to use and firm DBU from Nantucket/CA.
It is possible simply to use Fox or there Delphi any ;-).

Nevertheless, BDBFS has a niche.
At a development BDBFS the motto was:
	" We'll make with the chosen base, all that we want! "

You can use practically all functions necessary for daily jobs with bases!
Almost all of them can be called via hot-keys.
Besides it is desirable to have "near at hand" a uniform product for
jobs with different formats of bases and indexes.

	So, BDBFS is able:

	- automatically or optionally to choose a format
	  of indexes and MEMO-fields from Clipper,FoxPro,dBase4,SIX
	- to edit records in a mode BROWSE and EDIT
	- to print chosen base (optionally into file), all or on
	  condition
	- to prepare special report file
	- to modify base structure
	- to optimize base structure
	- to print structure on the printer or into a file
	- to search on a condition LOCATE / CONTINUE
	- to search for a context without binding to fields
	- to search in current field
	- to copy records
	- to copy contents of separate fields from the left and right
	  sides, from below and from above
	- to establish an existing index (or tag)
	- to make a new index (or tag)
	- to make "soft" index search
	- to make wildcard index search
	- Replace on a condition
	- Sum, Count, Total on a condition
	- Delete/Recall on a condition
	- Copy to File / Append from, including on a condition and
	  in text formats. The transformation and renaming of fields
	  is possible. MEMO-fields can be converted to different format.
	- to establish filters
	- to sort base
	- to establish the necessary order and quantity of fields,
	  their headings. The calculated fields are possible! Thus
	  the chosen cut can be printed out and is saved for further use!
	- to calculate any Clipper-expression
	- to set variables
	- to clear at once all record
	- to make Upper and Lower in text fields
	- to change modes of input
	- to work with the mouse
	- to choose all conditions from a history
	- to save and to restore an environment
	- to read ini-files
	- to highlight with colour various cells on a condition
	- to work with the own clipboard and Win-clipboard
	- independently to give back TimeSlices
	- "to freeze" fields for viewing
	- to search for a maximum / minimum
	- to change the disks / directories (Filer)
	- to use long names Win9x

	- and other pleasant trivialities.

	Almost all functions can be called as through hot keys, so
	and through the menu.

	Majority of functions is clear for any xBase-man (though
	acquaintance with Clipper it is desirable). Some explanatories
	are below. Appointments of all hot keys see in HELP and in report
	of keys.


	 2. Supported formats of the data.
	 ---------------------------------
	The formats of xBase-files are supported basic for today:

		 dBASE3/Clipper		 (DBT/NTX)
		 FoxPro			 (FPT/IDX/CDX)
		 dBASE4			 (DBT/MDX)
		 SIX3			 (SMT/NSX)

	It is really possible to make support NDX, if it is necessary
 for somebody else.
	As to other existing formats (Comix, Inx, etc),
 that at present I do not have drivers :-(.

	If the base has memo-field, the appropriate driver gets out
 automatically. Besides you can set the default driver in an ini-file
 or through the menu.

	If in an ini-file nothing is given, FoxPro (SIXCDX) driver is used.

	Except for standard Clipper-fields,  are supported Float (FoxPro),
 VariField (SIX) types.

	You'll be asked for password for SIX crypted files.


	 3. Editing of records.
	 ----------------------

	 At an entrance in BDBFS the program is in a mode "VIEW".

	For an entrance in a mode of edition it is necessary to press
 <Enter> in chosen field, then you receive practically Browse of FoxPro:
 keys <Up>, <Down>, <PgUp>, <PgDn>, <Tab>, <Shift-Tab> are acceptable.

	Besides BDBFS passes in a mode "BROWSE" by pressing any "simple"
 of a key depending on a type of a field. For example, at a presence
 of the cursor in a field such as Numeric, entrance in edition
 passes on pressing any figure, and this figure at once is displayed.
 For an exit from a mode "BROWSE" it is necessary to press <Escape> or
 <Ctrl-W>. As against FoxPro (dBase), for editing a memo-field special
 keys don't need to be pressed.

	There are four modes of input in "BROWSE". In "Usual" mode
 pressing <Enter> in last the field of record simply stops input;
 in a mode "Enter/skip" in this case there is a transition to first
 field of the following record; in a mode " Lock Enter" pressing
 <Enter> in any the field results in descent to record below in the
 same field. In a mode "Enter/stop" after pressing <Enter> there is
 a transition to a mode "VIEW".
 The modes can be switched during input.

	Except for a mode "BROWSE" there is a mode "EDIT" with showing
 records on a vertical. It is acceptable from a mode "VIEW" via hot key
 <AltE> (dit).
	It is sometimes convenient to edit a symbolical field exceeding
 the size of the screen, as a memo-field. It can be made on pressing a key
 <AltW> (ide).


	 4. Replace-modes.
	 -----------------

	BDBFS supports three Replace modes (all - in current field):
		- constant expression		<AltF4>
		- varied expression		<CtrlF4>
		- in the current record		<AltR>

	A difference between <AltF4> and <CtrlF4> we'll explain
 on an example:

	Let we stand in a field NUM on 15 records. Now we set
 expression of replacement Recno()+2 and condition - all records.

	Now via <AltF4> in all records the value 17 will be brought in,
 and via <CtrlF4> - accordingly 3,5,7..

	Can ask: and what for is necessary Replace in the current record,
 if it is possible simply to correct it? But imagine, that the field
 contents 3242756 and it is necessary to multiplicate it on 234.
 With <AltR> all is simple - Field*234.

	If <Shift> will be pressed when any replace function is called
 (f.e. <CtrlShiftF4>), the confirming will be required for each record.
 It's especially convient with varied expression.


	 5.Append/Copy.
	 --------------

	On a key <F3> the empty record is simply added,
 <AltF3> - offers to copy contents of current or last record.

	It is possible also to press <F3> in a mode "BROWSE", then will
 be educated new record with the copied current field.

	It is possible also to make "Append from file" (<CtrlF9>), and
 if in name of a file is specified extension other than DBF that will
 be made inquiry of file type: SDF, WITH DELIMITERS, DBF. Same concerns
 and to "Copy File" (<CtrlF3>).

	It is possible also to append from "myself" (current base).

	There are two conflict situation with appending: incompatible
 field types and numeric overflow. In BDBFS the disputable concept is now
 accepted: the maximal performance of operations. It means, that in the
 first case the attempt of types transformation  is made, and in
 second case the greatest possible number enters in a field. For example,
 if field's length is 3 and number is 1200, "999" will be entered.

	At copying a file it is possible to specify only required fields
  (via <AltF2>).

	The transformation and renaming of fields is accessible also
 at copying (to base, but not to SDF). It some kind of mini-"Query By
 Example". For example, you can set expressions in the list of
 fields:
	Num, Num*2 AS Double, Upper(Char), CTOF(Char) AS Secret

	If in terms of field is given the keywords "AS", the field in
 new base will be named with given name (Num*2 AS Double - the
 field in copied base will be called DOUBLE).  If the target field is not
 named (word AS is not used), a field will be named Exp_??, where ?? -
 serial number in the list (is similar FoxPro).

 If the expression can not be calculated, it is ignored.
	See also the description of function DBTrans().

 Is possible also to copy (to transform) base (table) in format HTML.
 This operation is accessible through the menu  File -> Create HTML.
	See also description of function Tb2Html().


	 6.SUM.
	 ------

	The summation always occurs on the current field,
 it is possible to choose and calculated field too (see below).
	It is possible to summarize numerical or symbolical field
 (i.e. SUM(VAL(field))). It is meant, that you know, that you do.
	It is possible to use and function Sum (see below).


	 7. Search in an index (tag).
	 ----------------------------

	When you search index key of DATE-type, it is not necessary
 to write CTOD.  So, is equally correct
		12/03/93  CTOD('12/03/93')  DATE()

	By search on an index of a symbolical type the value
 should be concluded in inverted commas. However, if the expression
 of search begins with figure or symbol with a code more than 127,
 the inverted commas are not obligatory.

	By default the search is conducted in a mode SoftSeek OFF
 (SET NEAR - for habitual to FoxPro). To set a mode SoftSeek ON
 it is necessary to make
		<AltG> Set(9, .t.)	// see Set.CH,
 or to write =Set(9,.T.) in an ini-file.

	Sometimes it happens necessary to find not unique
 records in an index. It can be made with the help of a key
 <Alt2>. The cursor thus will be established on duplicating record.

	For all drivers, except NTX (while), the search on a mask
 (naturally, in an index of a character type) is accessible also.
 The mask is similar DOS. For example, it is possible to set:

		{Alt[} 'B?LL',	// Is found: BILL
		{AltShift]}	// Have continued and have found: BYLL

		{Alt [} 'JO*SON' // Is found Johnson,Johanson etc.



	 8. Expressions of conditions.
	 -----------------------------

	At a choice of many functions BDBFS, you will be requested for
 condition of selection or search. To vary expressions in such conditions
 it is possible widely enough. Any can be applied as system,
 and user functions. Sole restriction - length expressions (no more
 than 255 symbols).


	 9.Set Fields.
	 -------------

	On <CtrlF2> you can set the contents, names, show format and
 order of fields. The contents of a field can be any allowable
 expression.  The symbols of national alphabets in the contents now are
 allowable only in russian version (see NATIONAL.TXT).

	Example:
	Contents of a field: If(Deleted(), [Yes], [No])
	Name: Is marked?

	To finish changes press <F10>. Then you can press again <CtrlF2>
to restore all fields.

	The calculated fields will not be editable. Besides, they can
 be used in expressions.

	The fields was markes as deleted (via DEL) will not be shown and
 edited. <F8>/<F7> blocks/unblocks all fields below current.

	The required order can be established by pressing <Ctrl+Up> or
 <Ctrl+Down>.

	The required order and contents of fields can be established
 consistently. Let's assume, we have removed from viewing some field.
 Have pressed <F10>. And now we don't want to see another field, not
 only previous.  Press again <CtrlF2> (to restore all fields),
 again <CtrlF2>, then <F5> and you can see previous established
 fields. Correct further, etc..

	Set Fields does not influent on "Copy TO" operation.


	 10.Calculation of expressions.
	 ------------------------------

	On pressing ShiftF6 (AltG(o), ?) it is possible to count up
 almost any correct Clipper expression of length up to 255 symbols.
 Not speaking about it is necessary to remember, what number was
 Date()-21 or quickly to take Log(Exp(1)) :-), it has turned out rather
 interesting simulator for Clipper-programmer. It is possible, for example,
 to experiment with parameters Memoedit, to understand, at last, than
 differs Bin2i from Bin2w or to take an interest, that such
 Descend('╜┤╖░░╗о').

	It is possible to use almost all functions from Clipper.Lib and
 Extend.Lib, number useful (on my sight) functions of known libraries
 Six3, NanFor, Clipper Tools, Netto, Blinker, emulation of some functions
 FoxPro, and also number of special functions BDBFS.
	The list of functions will be given below.


	 11.The initialization of variables.
	 -----------------------------------

		On <CtrlF5> you can initialize variable (or to set
	it's new value).

	For simple variable it is necessary simply to execute assignment

		new=5
		word:='daddy'
		today=date()

	For the announcement of a array it should be described:

		arr[20] or arr=Array(20)

	Then it is possible to make Arr[3]=Exp(12.09).
	However, it is possible and directly to write:
		Arr := {10,20,'example'}

	Any correct Clipper expression are allowable in the right part.

	What for all this is necessary?

	You can, f.e. store result of previous operation and use it
	later.
		<F6>				// sum current field
		<CtrlF5>	Sum1:=__sum	// store it

	It is sometimes convenient to calculate expression, and then it
 to use in conditions. Using assignment variable and calculation
 expressions it is possible even to write small programs. Try, f.e.,
 to make following:
	<CtrlF5>	aPrg=Array[Adir('*.prg ')]
	<AltG>		Adir('*.prg ', aPrg)
	<AltG>		ForAch (5,10,24, 'Program', aPrg)

 Selecting the index, which has non-standard extension.

	<CtrlF5>	_oldind:='MyOwn.FIL '
	<CtrlF5>	_req=0

 Choosing base from backup copies.

	<CtrlF5>	_mask = '*.bak'
	<F4>


 Printing base with a fine font and with the slogan.

	<CtrlF5>	_PSCode ='We are the champions ' +chr(15)
	<F2>

	It is possible to give the block of a code
	<CtrlF5>	bck = {| i|i+1} , then
	<AltG>		Eval(num)


	Some examples are in Examples.Ini.


	 12.Structure modifying.
	 -----------------------

	After change of structure, previous version remains with
 extension BAK. If there was a memo-file, it remains with extension TBK.

	If at updating there is a situation of numerical overflow,
 that in a field will be brought 0.

	In the program is realized known Clipper-trick - symbolical
 fields with length more than 255 symbols. For those who does not know, -
 it is made so: in a field Field_Dec enters  Mod(Length, 256), in a field
 Field_Len - rest. For example: length of a field is 700. Then
 Field_Dec=2, Field_Len=188. But to enter necessary length in BDBFS
 it is enough to correct Field_len. Then the necessary sizes will be brought
 automatically.

	<F9> (except for the driver SIXMDX) causes function of structure
 optimization (like in OTTO utility from SIX-driver). It is made with
 using VariField by the following rules:
	- All CHARACTER fields greater than 16 characters are
	  defaulted to 10 byte "V" fields.  However, for short CHARACTER
	  fields,  or those whose data is always a fixed length, you may
	  want to change them back to "C" types manually instead of using
	  "V" types.

	- All MEMO fields are defaulted to 6 byte "V" fields.

	- All NUMERIC fields greater than  four bytes long and less than
	  11 bytes long are converted to four  byte "I" (long integer
	  fields.

	- All 8 byte DATE fields are converted to 3 byte DATE fields.


	For non-English named fields see NATIONAL.TXT.


	 13.An insert of record.
	 -----------------------

	As is known, Clipper doesn't have the operation INSERT.
 But sometimes it would be desirable very much. Therefore it is necessary
 to go by heavy way: append, to move all downwards, to clear top.
 On the large bases it can take long time. At the switched on index
 INSERT does not work.


	 14.TOTAL.
	 ---------

	The are some difference between TOTAL in BDBFS and in Clipper:
		- "ON" expression always equals IndexKey(0),
		   so it doesn't work in SORTed base;
		- ALL fields are copied to the new database (Clipper
		  excludes memo-fields);
		- if field "TOTALCOUNT" exists, it will be filled with
		  number of totalled records on each key expression;
		- fields with alias (like base->fld1) aren't supported.


	 15.Saving / restoring an environment.
	 -------------------------------------

	You can define any variable, set conditions of search and
 summation, to define an index and necessary fields etc., and
 then to save all this in a usual memo-file, having pressed <ShiftF1>.
	If then at any moment to press <ShiftF5> and to set a name
 of this file, the all this environment, including used DBF, will be
 (whenever possible) restored. Besides, it is possible at once to load
 an environment, having set a name MEM-file in a command line. Certainly,
 can be as much as necessary files of an environment in the directory.
	The file BDBFS.MEM is used by default.
	If variable _AutoSave: =.T. is determined in a INI-file
 (or directly from the program), the file BDBFS.MEM is created in the
 current directory automatically at an exit.
	If variable _AutoRestore: =.T. is determined in a INI-file  and
 BDBFS.EXE is started without parameters, a file BDBFS.MEM from current
 directory is read out automatically.


	 16.Initialization files.
	 ------------------------

	You can at loading or later, on pressing <CtrlF12>, to read
 contents of a file of initialization. The file of initialization
 represents from itself a usual text file, containing assignment variables,
 and also, probably, performance of some functions, mini-programs.
	Variable will be then are accessible in the program.

	The following operations are determined:

	A. Assignment, for example,
			MyVar=100 or
			MyVar: = 100 or
			MyVar=Sqrt(4) or
			#define MyVar 100

	In the latter case, as against include of files Clipper
 and C, variable will be announced and are accessible not only in time
 readings of a file of initialization.

	B. Function evaluation without assignment variable, f.e.,
			=Tone(440,3)

	C. Inclusion of a secondary file of initialization
			#include second.ini

	As the operation #define is supported, it is possible to
 include standard Clipper files of definitions, such as inkey.ch, Set.ch.
 It is necessary to have only in a kind, that #define with parameters and
 the SET INCLUDE path to a file is not supported. It is necessary to
 specify full path directly.

	The attention for Clipper & C - programmers: the name of a file
 is given without inverted commas.


	D. Definition of the command, for example,

	  #xCommand INVERT =>;
		    DBEval({||Rlock(),IF(DELE(),dbRecall(),dbDelete())})
	  #xCommand MODIFY COMMAND <x> = > ModiFile (<x>)

	As against commands of Clipper-preprocessor, is supported only
 one parameter (or absence of parameters).
	It is most natural to apply commands from calculation of
 expressions, for example:
		{?} INVERT


	E. Definition of the macros. A format is:

		#MACRO < key code > < a sequence of pressing >.

	The sequence of pressing can be given or as symbolical
 line (KEYBOARD format), or as a array of codes (INKEY format).
 In the second case it is possible to set the functional and extended keys,
 but length of a sequence is less or equal 16 symbols.

	For example,
		#MACRO 307 = > {-9, 'F', 'A'}
		;Create HTML via menu on ALT-<.

		#MACRO 308 = > "It we'll press quite often at edition"


	F. Announcement of the local variables.

		#LOCAL <v1>,<v2>...

	Example:
		#LOCAL cFile,nSum

	 Inline assignments are prohibited:
		#LOCAL cX:=""		//Error!!!


	G. Execution's termination.

		#BREAK  or  #BREAK <condition>

	#BREAK without parameter forces the immediate termination of
 the ini-file interpretation, #BREAK with <condition> terminate the
 interpretation if condition are valid:

	#BREAK File("NeedFile")


	H. Parameters and return value.

	Up to 5 parameters can be passed to ini-file. They are
 accessible via _1.._5 identificator. Ini-file can return the value to
 the calling process:
	#RETURN 4.
	#RETURN _1*_2+_3

 #RETURN doesn't terminate the interpretation, it only defines the
 result. There can be more than one #RETURN in ini-file.

	The calling of ini-file with parameters is suitable from
 calculation or user menu:

	{?} RestoreIni("MyPlug",Date(),"Example",2.4)

	You can use the recurrent RestoreIni(), so in "MyPlug" can be
	written:

	=RestoreIni("R2")
	and so on.

	You probably will want to use functions For() and While() for
 organization cycling in ini-files (see below).

	The demonstration file Examples.ini contains a lot of various
 examples. I think, that it is easier to look at it.

	At start of the program the attempt is made to read a file
 BDBFS.INI, taking place in the program's start directory. If file of
 initialization is not given in a command line, then the attempt is made
 to consider a file BDBFS.ini, taking place in the current directory (at
 its absence is searched BDBF.INI - for compatibility with the previous
 versions of BDBF).

	If the file with extension .AOP (Auto Open) will be found in
 the current directory, it will be read automatically when the base
 with appropriate name will be opened. You can define some commands,
 variables, menu (see ch.30) specific for this base. Besides, you can
 define list of necessary fields here. Fields list is given in variable
 FIELDS and headers list in variable HEADS. Formats (show patterns) of
 fields can be given in variable PICTURES. Calculated fields can be also
 given.

	Example.

	Fields:={'Char','Num','Num*2'}
	Heads:={'Character;field','Numeric;field','Double value'}
	Pictures:={, '999,999.99'}

	You can also define other useful instruction (see also
	Supplement IV). For example it's possible to establish necessary
	index or tag:
		_IndexFile:="MyIndex"		or
		__TagNom:=3			or
		__TagName:='MyTag'


	 17. Macro-keys.
	 ---------------

	On pressing <CtrlF1> the sequence of symbols, saved in variable
 _MACRO is called. In a mode VIEW this opportunity works as Set Key,
 in edition - as Set Function.

		Example:

	<CtrlF5>  _Macro=chr(4) +chr(4) +chr(13)

	Now, in a mode VIEW, on <CtrlF1> you will enter edition of a field
	CurrentField+2

	<CtrlF5>  _macro ='Bravo!'

	Now, in a modes of edition, on <CtrlF1> in a field the text will
	be written down  Bravo!

	It is convenient, when it is necessary in an interactive mode to
	bring in many fields similar information.

	In a mode of edition the following macros are in addition
	determined:
		Alt(	=	() and cursor inside of brackets
		Alt)	=	() and cursor outside
		Alt{	=	{}
		Alt"	=	[]
		AltA	=	.AND.
		AltO	=	.OR.
		AltB	=	{||}
		AltC	=	CTOD("//")

	It is especially convenient at definition of a condition.

	It is possible to define and own macros:

		<AltG> __SetFunction (< a code of a key >, < macros >),
	or via command #MACRO in ini-file.

	Besides in a mode of edition the "hot" keys are accessible
 transformations of the current focus of input (same work and in VIEW):
		AltU	= UpperCase
		AltL	= Lower
		AltK	= Capitalize (Proper)
		AltQ	= English -> National (if you casually have typed
			  something in "English" keyboard instead of
			  "National").
		AltY	= on the contrary.


	 18.An exit to DOS.
	 ------------------

	At an exit to DOS via <AltF10>, BDBFS occupies in memory 8k.

	If you want to start the large program directly under BDBFS,
	it is possible to use function

	<AltG> BliRun('FoxPro').


	 19. Using of a mouse.
	 ---------------------

		In a mode of viewing the following rules work:

	- any button on a line of the base name = Select Base
	- any button on a line of the field names  = Set Fields
	- any button on a functional line = appropriate function
	  (exception: right button on <F10> finishes without demand),
	  including and with Ctrl, Shift and Alt
	- any button on bottom scroll bar - transition  on
	  relative position of a field in a file
	- any button in the basic space (4-MaxRow()-3 lines) =
	  transition to this field
	- left button on the same field = <Enter>
	- any button on MaxCol() column - transition in a file on relative
	  position.

		In a mode of a choice on Achoice (f.e., at a choice of an
	 index):

	- right button = <Escape>
	- left on the top framework = <PgUp>
	- left on the bottom framework = <PgDn>
	- left inside - first time: stay on an element, second time:
	  select it.

		In the menu and in a modes of edition:

	- right button = <Escape>
	- left button = <Enter>

		At a showing of the warning messages - any button =
	  any key.


	 20.Compatibility with FoxPro.
	 -----------------------------

	BDBFS is able to look and to edit files FoxPro with memo-fields.
  The index files are completely supported.

	As it was already marked, in Browse the keys <Tab>, <Shift-Tab>,
 <Ctrl-T> are supported.
	System variable of printing and the amount of the processed records
 have the same names, as in FoxPRO.
	In expressions it is possible to use almost all functions FoxPro,
 not corresponded with screen (Screen, Menu) and printed forms.
	The correctness of blocking in a network is provided.

	If there is a file EUROPEAN.MEM in the current directory,
 it is read out at start.

	The field type "GENERAL" currently isn't supported.


	 21. Job in a network and multitask systems.
	 -------------------------------------------

	All files are opened in mode of sharing for records, that allows
 various processes to use the same base.
	The tests were spent in a network NOVELL and in sessions DV, OS/2,
 Windows 3.11, Windows 9*.

	The joint job with dBase by the applications using is guaranteed
 standard mode of blocking. The joint job is not guaranteed, f.e.
 with Dbview from Norton-Commander.

	BDBFS independently gives back TimeSlice, so at job in
 multitask systems there is no necessity for the extraneous programs
 such as TAME.


	 22. Processing of errors.
	 -------------------------

	Generally, many efforts are undertaken, that wrong the actions
 did not finish completely job. Besides a number possible disputed
 situations manage before their occurrence.

	Nevertheless mistakes of the program are not excluded.
	In this case BDBFS draws the frame and writes something like
		"Incorrect expression bla-bla"
  The large request: notice it "bla-bla" and inform me.
  But mean, that such message can arise and as a result your incorrect
  input of expression, then it is necessary simply to recover.

	There is, however, number of non-restorable mistakes, f.e.,
 " Disk full ". It can appear, for example, at copying a file
 (to check up beforehand it is difficult, since it is not known, how
 much places will be occupied by a file, selected on a condition).
 So, be attentive.


	 23.Expressions of colours.
	 --------------------------

	You can allocate with colour in current field of records
 adequate certain condition. For example,

		<AltB> BirthDate > CTOD('01/01/1960')

	The colour is defined 6 and 7 pair primary colour of edition.
 Have in view of, that the deleted records are shown by 4 and 5 pair.

	To change colour is possible having corrected variable _bm
 (see below) through the task of expressions or menu  (File - Settings -
 Colors).

	To return standard colors you should press <AltShiftB>.


	 24.Jobs with the clipboard.
	 ---------------------------

	It is supported buffer of an exchange, which works and in
 mode VIEW and in a mode GET. For record of value of the current cell in
 mode VIEW or current value of edition - press <CtrlGreyPlus>.
 For input in a cell (at conformity of types) - <AltGreyEnter> or
 <CtrlGreyMinus>.

	It is possible to make operations	+ - * /
 directly with clipBoard and current cell (last 2, naturally, only with
 numerical values), pressing <Alt+corresponding Grey>. It is possible to
 see the current value of ClipBoard by pressing <CtrlEnter>.

	In a mode of editing of memo-fields the writing from clipBoard
 is accessible. During a showing of result of calculation, summation, etc
 is accessible record calculated in ClipBoard. However, it is possible
 and directly save result in a field.

	The operations of entering in the buffer are accessible and at
 a showing of results operations.

	It is very convenient to use ClipBoard for the giving various
 conditions. For example, you have set long expression of search. Remember
 it on <CtrlGrey+>. Now you want to copy all records, satisfying to this
 condition. Proceed in dialogue of copying and at inquiry conditions press
 <CtrlGrey->.

	At job in Win95 (not NT!) is accessible and Windows ClipBoard.
 There (and therefrom) it is possible to copy the current field. These
 operations is accessible via <CtrlIns>, <ShiftIns>.


	 25. A history of conditions and expressions.
	 --------------------------------------------

	All conditions, expressions, lists of fields, are given during
 a session the works, and also results of calculations, summation,
 calculations are brought in a history, thus the control on doubling
 will be carried out. Accordingly, at the task of conditions and
 expressions, it is possible to use this history.
	<F4> (<CtrlDown>) calls a history of the current condition,
	<AltF4> (<CtrlShiftDown>) - history of all conditions,
	<CtrlF4> - history of results.

	The unnecessary conditions can be erased through keys
		<F8> or <CtrlD>.


	 26. Stack of positions.
	 -----------------------

	It is possible to remember up to 10 positions (records) in base
 and to pass to them when need. Such opportunity is feature for
 the text editors; I do not know, as far as it will be useful here.
 Nevertheless, WordStar and Borland "were plundered" and on
 <CtrlK>+ 0.. 9 the bookmarks are established. They can be restored on
 <CtrlQ>+ 0.. 9.  After pressing <CtrlK> or <CtrlQ> pressing 0.. 9 is
 expected within 20 seconds, then is reset.

	 27. Edition of мемо-fields and external files.
	 ----------------------------------------------

	It's possible to use the internal or external editor for edition
of мемо-fields, and also external files (by pressing F4 in filer or
through the menu "File" - "Modify text"). The internal editor uses
standard function MemoEdit and works when variable _MemoEditor is
not given (for example, in an ini-file). Variable can be given as
String, for example, _MemoEditor:='c:\medit\me.exe' (then always will
be used MultiEdit) or as an array of arrays:
	{Field's Mask,			// f.e "BM*"
	 External editor,		// f.e. "ME"
	 Shift in a мемо-field,		// by default 0 - whole field
	 The additional options,	// by default are absent
	 Temporary file			// by default $$BDBF$$.COM }.

	The external editor can be not given, then it is supposed, that
in a мемо-field the program resides (for example, screen - saver), which
simply is started. The shift in a мемо-field happens it is necessary to
set, if the мемо-field keeps the diverse information. For example,
animals.dbf from Delphi distributive contains a field BMP, where
picture is stored from 9 positions.

Example:
     _MemoEditor:={	{'BMP', 'pv', 9, '/d'},;
			{'SAVER', '', 0, ",'tmp.com"},;
			{'*','ME ', 0, "};
		}
	So, PV.EXE will be called on a field with the name BMP,
the field SAVER contains executable programs, and for edition all rest
will be called MultiEdit.

	The internal editor can't edit files with the size more than
64K. But also at use of the external editor it is necessary to
remember, that the memo-fields of a format DBT are not capable
to store the section more 64K. If your file has large length,
at recording it in a field of a format DBT it will be cut off.


	 28. The printing forms.
	 -----------------------

	Besides a usual printing on F2, since the version 1.13,
it is possible to use special definitions for a report forms. Form are
stored in usual textual files and contain instructions for definitions of
columns, groupings, summarizing, etc.

	Report forms can use the following variables:

	_aExpr - array of expressions for each column.
	_aHead - array of column's headings. Default == _aExpr
	_aElen - array of column's widths. Default = width of a field

	Width of a column is defined as maximal between width of
column heading and _aElen for this column. If width of a field is more,
than width of a column, it is made correct carry (up to 10 lines in a
column) on separators:  space,tabulation, .,;?!

	_aPict	 - array of pictures for each column.

	_aTitle	 - report title. Default - nothing.  Can be given as a
		   string or array of strings.

	_cFile	 - output file.  Default - name of base + '.PRN'.

	_aSum	 - array of necessity of summation for each column.

	_fCondit - print condition.

	_aFooter - name of additional procedure printing a form footer or
		   array containing the footer.

	_pEveryStep - name of additional procedure or block called
		      before a printing of each line satisfying to a
		      condition _fCondit

	_aGroup - array specifying report group.
		Structure of a array:
		{
		<Expression of grouping>,;
		[<an array or block for a printing of group heading>],;
		[<an array or block for a printing of group footer>]
		[<logical: print the group sum only if more than 1 element
		  are in group>]
		}.
		Default for group heading:
			'Code' + <Expression of a grouping>.
		Default for group footer: "Total:".
		Default for a printing of the sum: .F. (to print the sum
		always).

	_nDouble - attribute of necessity of a printing in two columns on
		   a sheet. If 0 or is not given - one is printed. If
		   numerical parameter is given - is perceived as
		   amount of blanks between two columns.

	_NoShow - don't offer a file for viewing and printing.

	_aPage - array specifying grouping on page.
		Structure:
		{
		 [<an array or block for a printing of page heading>],;
		 [<an array or block for a printing of page footer>]
		}.
	If it's determined, the totals of page are printed. Header
	of page is printed, since second.

	cDivideT, cDivide - delimiter of columns in the header and
		information lines accordingly (default - ':').

	_nCounter - if > 0, a serial line number is printed at the left
		    side of sheet (with width _nCounter).

	CountName - name of a column for serial number (default "NN").
		    It is meaningful only if _nCounter > 0 is given.

	_PrintZero - whether to print of zero values, by default - .F.

Following variables can be additionally adjusted directly from
the programs (by pressing F9 in dialogue of a beginning of a printing).

Printing of heading on each page	_NeedHeadPage
Printing of numbers of pages		_NeedPrPage
Page eject after each sheet		_NeedEject
Starting sequence of the printer	_PSCode
Final sequence of the printer		_PECode
The left margin				_LMargin
Page length (0=tape)			_Plength
Whether to print the standard heading	_NeedMainHead
The printer device			_printer
Whether to append to a file		_NeedApFile


Report-form files have standard extension .BPF and can be
loaded through the menu "Base" - "Read report template".

See also example in BDBFS distributive.


	 29. Keyboard codes.
	 ------------------

	Pressing in BDBFS on keys, pay attention to the left top corner,
 where are shown that you have pressed. There it is possible to see a lot
 of interesting. So, for example, press on <Ctrl-arrows>, <Alt-arrows> or,
 f.e., on  <Alt-BackSpace>. So it is possible to find out a number not
 documentary (at least, in Clipper 5.01) codes.


	 30. The user menu.
	 ------------------

	Besides the general menu, in BDBFS it is possible to define
 the additional user menu accessible on <F12>. For this purpose it is
 necessary in ini-file to define two arrays: UserMenuPrompts and
 UserMenuActs. First it is necessary to fill by lines offered on a choice
 in the menu, in second - by the appropriate blocks of a code. For example,
 you want to have an opportunity to start FoxPro from BDBFS. Then in
 BDBFS.INI it is necessary to write down:

	UserMenuPrompts: = {'Call FoxPro '}
	UserMenuActs: = {{|| SwpRunCmd('Fox.exe')}}.

	Some examples are in Examples.Ini.


	 31. Header checking.
	 --------------------

	 You can check the size of current base from menu
 "File -> Check Header". 3 numbers are compared: logical size
 (is calculated basing on structure and records size), "header" size
 (based on records number in base header) and real disk file size.
 If all sizes are equal, OK message will be shown. Besides, you'll be
 prompted for choice one of these sizes. Rest will be synchronized.
 I'll recommend logical size as most accurate (in common case).


	 32. Plug-ins.
	 -------------

	 "Plug-ins" of bdbfs are usual ini-files (see ch.16), realizing
 some completed function. Some examples (probably useful) are in
 PLUGINS\ directory. Send me your plug-ins, best will be published.


	 33. Start BDBFS.
	 ----------------

	It is possible to start it with parameter * - then will be offered
 files on a choice. It is possible to start BDBFS *.Str - on a choice will
 be offered files with extension STR. It is possible to use and symbol ?.

	Parameter /i = <indexname> sets loading a file together with
 specified index.

	Parameter /BW adjusts colours on monochrome.

	At start with a parameter - name of a file of an environment is
 made attempt to restore this environment. Similarly, with a file of
 initialization - see ch.15 and ch.16.

	The order of parameters /BW and /i = can be alternated.

	Besides there are some parameters forcing BDBFS to work in
batch mode - REINDEX, HTML, PACK, CHECK. In this mode BDBFS carries out
given operation and finishes the work.

	Parameter REINDEX causes reindexing of a base. A compound index
(CDX, NSX, MDX) reindexes automatically, for reindexing of simple index
it should be specified in third parameter with a key /i. If any
index is not found, the appropriate message will be given.

	Examples:
		BDBFS f_w_cdx REINDEX
		BDBFS f_w_ntx /REINDEX /i=MyNtx.ntx

	Parameter HTM (HTML) causes generation of a HTML file.

	Examples:
		BDBFS MyDbf HTM			// is generated MyDbf.htm
		BDBFS MyDbf /HTML=e:\1		// is generated e:\1.htm

	The warning of existence of a file is given out in any case,
	So if you wish to rewrite existing HTML without confirming,
	destroy it before!

	Parameter PACK causes packing of a base.

	Parameter CHECK causes testing of a base size (see ch.31).

	It is possible to apply the command FOR to work with the
catalogue.

	Examples:
// Reindex all
		FOR %a in (*.DBF) DO bdbfs %a REINDEX

// To create HTMLs in subdirectory _HTMLS_
		echo y | DEL _HTMLS_\*.HTM
		FOR %a in (*.DBF) DO bdbfs %a HTM=_HTMLS_\%a
		REN _HTMLS_\*.DBF _HTMLS_\*.HTM

 The happy owners 4DOS can save the command (and time):
		DEL /y _HTMLS_\*.HTM
		FOR %a in (*.DBF) DO bdbfs %a HTM=_HTMLS_\%@NAME[%a]


	 34.Video-modes
	 --------------

	BDBFS correctly supports all earlier established text
 modes - from 40*25 up to 132*60 etc.. However, if you have started
 from under BDBFS the program, changing a mode of the screen - troubles
 are possible.
	See also b132.bat in bdbfs.zip.


	 35.What is absent in BDBFS in comparison with "competitors".
	 ------------------------------------------------------------

	I had seen in products of similar purpose some features
 absent now in BDBFS.

	Their list:

	* Screen Saver - will not be, I don't like it,  use something
	  special, please.
	* A calendar - I don't see sense, IMHO it isn't ORGANIZER, but
	  your opinion...
	* The export / import 1-2-3 - IMHO it is too specialized.
	* The calculation of statistical such as deviation etc. - is
	  similar previous item.
	* The diagrams on fields of base - will not be, IMHO this
	  feature of special-programs.
	* the viewing of the screen DOS - may be...

	I'll be grateful for any opinions in this occasion.


	36. Known problems.
	-------------------

	Besides again found out mistakes, there is a number of known
	problems, which, probably, will be eliminated in the future.

	- the fields GENERAL of FoxPro are not supported;
	- the fields BMP of DBASE4 are supported partially (base is
	  browsable, the fields BMP are visible partially);
	- the files of DBASE4, DBASE5 with first byte 4 and 5 are not
	  supported;
	- the formats of FlagShip are not supported;

	- #define with parameters in ini-files is not supported;
	- #xCommand with more, than one  parameter is not supported;

	- problems with MDX indexes (restriction of the driver):
	  - the wildseek in indexes is not accessible;
	  - number of a key in an index and quantity of records in
	    the filter (without calculation) are not accessible. It is
	    reflected in correctness of  indicators showing;

	- problems with NTX indexes (restriction of the driver):
	  the wildseek in indexes is not accessible;

        - long names in filer are shown up to 16-symbols.

        - a nonrestorable mistake "Disk overflow" during COPY or APPEND
	  operation.

	- due to mistake in realization of TBROWSE object,
	  not all fields in base can be shown.  By default,
	  quantity of fields, are shown in BDBFS is limited to 170
	  (experimental limit on my computer is 173). You can
	  experiment by setting _nBrowMaxField variable in a INI-file.

	- internal error 1112. It appears on database with
	  long memo-fields (more than 64K). It's Clipper 5.2 fault (in
	  5.0 it wasn't). I can only advise to exclude such fields from
	  AutoOpen files (see ch.16). You can access them via
	  Sx_Blob2File() function.

	- FoxPro's indexes with expression like alias.field instead
	  alias->field cause the error when index field is changed.

	- noncompact IDX-s are not supported (restriction of SIX3
	  driver).

	 SUPPLEMENT  II. THE MESSAGES.
	 -----------------------------

	At opening base the following messages can be given:

	< a name of a file > - is damaged or is blocked.
	The heading of base is damaged or the base is locked by
	other process, or the base is marked as Read Only
	(I remind - BDBFS is Editor!).

	< a name of a file > - is damaged.
	There are damages to the list of fields of base or there are
	unsupported field type.

	< a name of a file > - incorrect format.
	It is absolutely not DBF on structure or it is base with
	unfamiliar type of a field (for example, General).


	 SUPPLEMENT  III. Supported functions.

	 B.Called functions.

	It is possible to call any internal function BDBFS, as well
 as system in any modes. It looks more natural to use this in a mode of
 calculation (ShiftF6, AltG, ?),or in a mode of assignment (CtrlF5).

	Examples:
		<AltG>		Aver('Example')
		<CtrlF5>	avrg=Aver('Example')

	For presentation of the explanatory we shall conduct on
	educational base

	NAME	S02	S03	S04
	Your	12	1	13
	Your1	32	2	33
	My	10	3	10
	My1	30	4	0


	1. Functions of calculation.

	------------------------------------------------------------
		SUM(< cExpr > [, < cCond >]) - > nResult

	Sum base on expression cExpr for a condition cCond.
	Returns Number.

	Examples:
		<AltG>	(1)	Sum ('S02+S03', '[My] $ Name')
			(2)	Sum ('S02', '.t.')


	(1) will return 47	(2) - 84

	If <cCond> is omitted, the scope is all records.

	Except for returned value the result is remembered in variable
		__Sum

	------------------------------------------------------------
		AVER(< cExpr > [, < cCond >]) - > nResult

	Calculates average on expression cExpr for a condition cCond.
	Returns Number.

	If second parameter is omitted, it is meant .t.

	Example:
		<CtrlF5>  MediumS2=Aver('S02', '[My] $ Name')

		will return 21

	------------------------------------------------------------
		COUN(< cCond >) - > nResult

	Counts up quantity of records satisfying to a condition cCond.

	Example:
		<CtrlF5>  CntMy=Coun ('[My] $ Name')

		will return 2

	If second parameter is omitted, it is meant .t.

	Except for returned value the result is remembered in variable
		__count

	------------------------------------------------------------
		SumLine([FromField], [ToField]) - > nResult

	Summarizes fields "lengthways" records, from numbers FromField
	up to numbers ToField.
	If is absent FromField calculation goes from first, if is absent
	ToField - up to last. The non-numerical fields are ignored.

	Examples: (for the first record)
		SumLine()	- > 26
		SumLine(1,2)	- > 12
		SumLine(3)	- > 14

	Except for returned value the result is remembered in variable
		__Go
	------------------------------------------------------------
		Like(cEtalon, cTest)

	Compares 2 lines in view of symbols of expansion ? And *.
	As against a DOS mask supposes a some * in a name.
	Has shown the same high-speed results, as same function of
	Clipper Tools (probably, algorithm is same).
	But EXE on 0.5K is less :-) .
	Examples:
		<F7> Like ('spr*.dbf', FileName)

		<AltG> Like ('?m*h', 'smith') - > .t.

	------------------------------------------------------------
		Crc32(< cExpr >)

	Counts the control sum of a line. The algorithm of PKZIP is used.

	Example: the control sum of all fields:
		Crc32(Name+XTOC(s02) +XTOC(s03) +XTOC(s04))

	------------------------------------------------------------
		Rand([< nExpr >])

	Returns a random number in a range from 0 up to 1.
	From everyone ExprN the identical sequence comes back.

	Example: Rand(Seconds())

	------------------------------------------------------------
		Random(< nMin >, < nMax >)

	Returns random integer in range from nMin up to nMax.

	Example: Random(0,1000)

	------------------------------------------------------------
		RoundIt(<nVar>,<nPlace)

	Correct rounding off. Clipper not always correctly carries out
	operation of a rounding off.

	Example:
		Round(1.025,2)		-->	1.02
		RoundIt(1.025,2)	-->	1.03


	2. Functions of transformation

	------------------------------------------------------------
		Capitalz(<cExpr>) - > ExprC

	Will transform symbolical expression to a line with first header.
	At absence of parameter returns an empty line.

	Example:
		Capitalz('LUGANSK')	- >  Lugansk

	-------------------------------------------------------------
		OemToAnsi(<cExpr>)

	Will transform a line to Windows char set (default: 1251).

	You can change char set to your own, to change variables
	_Oem_Set, _Ansi_Set in BDBFS.INI.

	Example:
		OemToAnsi('ЛУГАНСК')	--> ╦╙├└═╤╩

	------------------------------------------------------------
		AnsiToOem(<cExpr>)

	Inverse function to OemToAnsi() .

	----------------------------------------------------------
		SplitLine(<cExpr>)

	Will transform a line to an array. Array's elements are
	separated on points.

	Example:
		SplitLine('One,Two,Three') - > {'One', 'Two', 'Three'}

	----------------------------------------------------------
		dbTrans(cNewBase, Fields [, bFor, bWhile, nNext, lRest])

	Copies base in given with an opportunity of renaming or
	transformation of fields.
	The list of fields is set or in inverted commas (as a line), or as
	the array (that is necessary at the giving of expressions with
	points).
	If in the list of fields the calculated fields are not given, works
	completely to similarly system command COPY.
	See also topic 5.Append/Copy of the present description.


	Examples:
		DBTrans('NewFile','Char,Num AS Digit,Num*2 AS Double')

		DBTrans('NewFile',{'LEFT(Char,2) AS Symbol','Num'},;
			{||Num<>0})

	------------------------------------------------------------
		TB2Html([cHtmlFile, cTitle ,aDesign])

	Will transform current TBrowse object to a format HTML.
	If the name of a file is not given - it is requested. An array
	of colours aDesign has structure:
		{page background color,
		table background,
		text color for table and header,
		text color for deleted records}.
	Default: "navy","blue","white","red".

		Example:

		Tb2Html('MyBase','WWW FOREVER!',;
			{'fffffc0','fffff80','00000ff','black'})


   3. Other.


	--------------------------------------- ---------------------
		ModiFile(cFileName)	- > .T. at successful record

	Elementary text editor. As uses MemoEdit, it can edits files up
	to 64K. In conditions of small amount of memory, this size can
	decrease.
		Example:
			ModiFile('c:\config.Sys')

	------------------------------------------------------------
		Scatter()

	Writes down contents of the current record in a array with a
	name _Scatter.
	The attribute of deleting enters in last element of an array.

	------------------------------------------------------------
		Gather()

	Writes down in the current record an array with a name _Scatter,
	it is usual created by function Scatter().

	------------------------------------------------------------
		SWAP(recno1, recno2)

	Exchanges through the buffer contents 2 records with physical
	numbers recno1, recno2.
		Example:
			Swap(1,3)

	------------------------------------------------------------
		WORK(HEAD) - > cResult

	Defines the true name of a field on heading.
	It happens it is necessary in case of the giving of fields on
	<CtrlF2>, when you not remember, how a field really was called,
	and its name should be specified, for example, in search.

		Example:
			Work('My name for 2 field') - > 'S02'

	------------------------------------------------------------
		MakeEmpty(fieldname/varname)

	Returns empty value of the current type.
	It: 0 for Numeric, "" for Character, / / for Date, .F. for Logical.
	See also key <ShiftF4>.

	------------------------------------------------------------
		FindMax(NeedMax [, FieldName], [EvalBlock]) - > MaxVal

	Universal function of search of a maximum / minimum.
		Parameters:
			NeedMax - .T., if the maximum is necessary,
				  .F. - minimum
			FieldName - field or expression, by default -
				    current field.
			EvalBlock - block of a code calculated for
				    comparison,by default - value
				    FieldName ({|i| i})

		Examples:

			FindMax(.T.,'S02 ') - > 32

			FindMax(.F.,'S02 ') - > 10

// Length the longest name

		FindMax(.T.,'Name ',{|i |Len(Trim (i))}) -> 5
		(is found ' Your1 ')

	------------------------------------------------------------
		PrintEdit([cFileName])

	Write down the current record on the device of a printing
	in the unwrapped kind. Without parameter - on the printer.
	On pressing <AltP> in BDBFS - into the file with a name
	<currentbase>.Rec.
	Appending/rewriting of a file depends on the appropriate
	adjustment printer.


		Example:

				NEW.DBF Record 1
	----------------------------------------
	NAME				Your
	S02				12
	S03				1
	S04				13

	------------------------------------------------------------
		For(< nFrom >, < nTo >, < bEval >, < bFor > )

	"FOR" cycle. Can be useful, for example, in INI-files.
	Codeblock bEval is executed when Eval(bFor)==.T..
	The cycle variable is transferred to the bEval and bFor as
	parameter. bEval and bFor can be of Codeblock or Character type.


	Examples:
		cSet:=''
		For(1,254,{|_1|cSet:=cSet+CHR(_1)}) --> '...■'

		nSum:=0
		For(1,FCOUNT(),{|i| nSum:=nSum+FIELDGET(i)**2},;
		    {|i| VALTYPE(i)=='N'})

		nSum:=0
		For(1,FCOUNT(), "nSum:=nSum+MyField**2")

	Some examples are in PLUGINS directory.

	------------------------------------------------------------
		While(<bCondition>, <bEval> [,<bFor>] [,<lBase>])

	"WHILE" cycle. If lBase==.T., SKIP is executed after each bEval.
	bCondition, bEval and bFor can be of Codeblock or Character type.

	Example:
		cName:=''
		While( '!EOF()', {|| cName+= Name},,.T.)

	Result:	'YourYour1MyMy1'

		cName:=''
		While( '!EOF()', {|| cName+= Name},'s02<30',.T.)

	Result:	'YourMy'

	Some examples are in PLUGINS directory.
